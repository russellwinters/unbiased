# V2 Documentation Archive

This directory contains completed V2-specific documentation from past work phases. Documents are moved here once the related work has been completed and integrated.

## Purpose

- **Preserve Historical Context**: Maintain a record of POCs, investigations, and implementations
- **Reduce Docs Clutter**: Keep the docs directory focused on current/active documentation
- **Reference Material**: Provide access to past technical decisions and implementations

## Archived Documents

Each archived document includes:
- **Archive Note**: Summary of the work, completion status, and related commit
- **Original Content**: Full documentation as it existed at completion
- **Commit Link**: Direct link to the commit representing the completed work

## Current Archive Contents

- **RSS_POC_SUMMARY.md** - RSS Feed POC implementation summary
- **source_errors.md** - RSS feed source error investigation

## Access

All archived documents are read-only references. For current API documentation and active planning, see the parent docs directory.
